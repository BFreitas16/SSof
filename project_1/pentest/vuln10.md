# Vulnerability 10: XSS in registry form allows attacker to run javascript code on other user's browsers

- Vulnerability: Stored XSS
- Where: `username` in registry form
- Impact: Allows the attacker to run javascript code on other users' browsers everytime they load a page that shows the attacker's username.
**There is a limit on the length of the username but it's enough for a dead link for example** `<base href=//0>`

## Steps to reproduce

1. Create a user with username `<svg/onload=alert()>`
2. Use any password
3. Create a public post/send friend requests to other users
4. Alert pops up
