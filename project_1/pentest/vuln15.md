# Vulnerability 15: SQL Injection updating profile allows to drop any table present in database 

- Vulnerability: SQL Injection
- Where: `update_profile` in any field
- Impact: Drops a table in the database

## Steps to reproduce

1. Go to Profile page
2. Enter your current password and insert the following payload in the about field: `None', photo = '' WHERE username = 'asd'; DROP TABLE Posts -- ` (space at the end is important)
3. To validate, go back to the home page and an SQL error pops up saying the table was dropped

NOTE:  
- A different payload can be injected in any other field of `update_profile`.
