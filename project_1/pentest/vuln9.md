# Vulnerability 9: XSS on profile picture allows attacker to run javascript code on other user's browsers

- Vulnerability: Stored XSS
- Where: User profile `photo` name
- Impact: Allows to run any code everytime an error occurs when loading a malicious profile photo

## Steps to reproduce

1. Rename a photo by adding malicious code inside and "onerror" event block (e.g. `picture onerror=alert(1).jpg`)
2. Submit the malicious photo and update your profile
3. The website redirects to the updated profile 
4. The browser tries to load the image, triggers an error and the code is executed
5. To attack other users, simply create a new post on the website and everytime a logged in user accesses the main page it triggers the event
