# Vulnerability 6: CSRF

- Vulnerability: CSRF
- Where: `/request_friend`
- Impact: Allows a malicious user to perform actions if the victim has an active session - although the attacker cannot change profile settings, he can send friend requests. For example, It's bad because the attacker can create a post with XSS and steals the cookie.

## Steps to reproduce

1. Create a Website with the malicious code (for example: see `POC`)
2. Encourage the victim to open the malicious website with the following examples:
    * Via email
    * Creating a post with the link to the website
    * By recreating one of the previous XSS making the victim open the link
3. The malicious code is executed if the user has an active session
